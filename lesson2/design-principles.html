							Google is a vastly used search engine site that's intuitive to use but backed with a huge
							amount of power searching through hundreds of billions of webpages to return you millions of
							results in milliseconds. Used so much that its name "Google" has become synonymous with
							searching the web at all in terms like "Google it" or "Googling".
						</p>
						<p>
							Google's site could have searching done strictly through a list of terms like "Apple",
							"Pie", "Minnesota", "Horse", gotten every result for each and then interesected them and
							made a UI to boot. Building on top of that would've been features like negative searches,
							where a word wouldn't be included etc. All of these things could've made a robustly feature
							filled search engine filled up in buttons and options. Instead, Google made a natural
							language processor to try to contextually understand what a user wants by a search.
						</p>
						<p>
							Along with this, Google keeps its most necessary additional tools behind hamburger menus
							increasing the clarity of the main interactive element; the search input. From there all it
							takes is simple text, a question you might ask a person written how you would with a ton of
							hidden complexity from "filetype:.pdf" to quotes themselves for exact matching.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a phenomenal example of clean design that has no doubt added a huge amount of
							complexity to Google's searching algorithm and design, however now the webpage is much
							simpler than some search engines designed for websites and has made itself the standard.

						<p>
							FoundryVTT at solely its initial appearance is like many other virtual table tops or VTT
							short. However, I include it in this list because it's one of the most well community
							designed software options out there with a strong API to allow for feature addition to be
							able to create things the core development team simply cannot prioritize.
						</p>
						<p>
							Being so focused on developer freedom can be a detriment though. Using arbitrary HTML, CSS,
							and JS without any shared designs, icons, etc. the UI would clash highly with itself. This
							is really where Foundry's developer focused design shines because instead of solving this
							with developer sandboxed design, it solves the freedom by driving good community standards
							first then actually implementing them into the core software as a first class option for all
							developers so they don't replicat each other.
						</p>
						<p>
							The end result is that despite being highly modded through
							<a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/">game systems and modules</a> to customize the
							game experience, the shared api and free assets allows each programmer to create their own
							unique experience through their module while still replicating the look and design. It'd be
							impossible to show off the module design through a singular screenshot if it were not for
							the universality of them. Because the dialog is so used throughout every module along with
							similarly styled popups, sidebars, and more, the modules all feel cohesive.
						</p>
						<p>
							With the built in support of module settings, module selection, world creation, and more
							each module feels natural and even if the site isn't the furthest along graceful design
							itself on mobile devices, the UI is impressively uniform especially for being a product with
							such active developers.

						<p class="disclaimer">
							It probably should've occurred to me before I wrote this up, but this is also made by
							Google, but it's almost certainly designed by different teams with different backings and
							reasons so I'll consider it distant enough to include it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Golang's package discovery page is my current favorite design of. By aggregating published
							Go packages into one place to discover their unified format for documentation with strong
							standards it makes using new packages much easier.
						</p>
						<p>
							The page starts off with the core features of the page "Overview" which has text describing
							the page, "Index" which is the table of contents for the page and "Example" which includes
							code examples for the . These three things are inarguably the main focus of the site and the
							first things that any visitor will want to look at. Having the links so prominent helps
							defeat Hick's law. It then leads a visitor towards more fine grained options that they will
							need with only a few clicks to also prevent click fatigue.
						</p>
						<p>
							The index later on is also sorted which helps to speed up a search of the contents even when
							there are quite a lot. Along with seperation of modules, it keeps the finding of a relevant
							method or type very simple and fast. Finally, additional information for each item is hidden
							behind expanded areas (which can all be opened at once) to keep the scroll short for
							visitors that don't want to look for that.
						</p>
						<p>
							All together, the website is well designed to help Hick's law and present the minimal
							meaningful options to a user which is a relief amongst forks of poorly designed websites or
							self made documentation that doesn't meet a unified standard like there is in Go. Along with
							strong design patterns to try to keep the API of a package reasonable, Go has made itself to
							be my favorite place to go for documentation and to find packages.
